Hi <%= name %>,

From what we can tell, there hasn't been any activity on your <%= exercise.language.name %> <%= exercise.exercise_type.slug %> submission for over a week. We think the ball is in your court, but this is a very inexact science, so we could be wrong.

Your submission has gone into hibernation, which means that it is no longer showing up in the list of pending assignments.

To get the ball rolling again, you can respond to the nitpicks, or submit a new version.

There's no pressure, of course, if you have better things to do, that's understandable!

Feel free to send me an email [ katrina.owen@gmail.com ] if you have any thoughts, ideas, or suggestions. I'm always looking to make the site better, so if you want to share frustrations or less-than-awesome experiences, I'm game for that too.

Thanks for trying exercism.io out.

Kind regards,
Katrina
